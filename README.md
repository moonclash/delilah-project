## Delilah - responsive CSS & JavaScript framework for building interfaces

Delilah is an easy to use framework that provides out-of-the box functionality for building responsive interfaces.
It features pre-defined styling and components thata allow the user to simply provide markup with certain class 
names that correspond to the pre-defined styles in the framework, and the framework will automatically apply styling
and layout.

### Features

- Responsive container

- A centered container with a default maximum width of `1200px` that scales down on smaller screens
- Responsive 12 column grid

- 12 grid responsive layout built with flexbox - choose the number of columns desired in a row and the framework distributes their sizes accordingly. The grid will adjust itself accordingly on different screen sizes
  
- Browser resets
  - Every browser renders certain elements in its own way. To eliminate inconsistency between browsers, there is a normalize file that brings default browser styling to a consistent way
  
 - Typography
  - Pre-built typography that creates various font sizes, font rendering, line-heights and letter spacing
